    "This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the optimal fifth player for a home team NBA lineup, based on historical game data from 2007 to 2015. By analyzing partial team compositions and allowed game features, the goal is to improve the home team's performance using data-driven player recommendations. The model is built using XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for high performance in classification tasks. The solution adheres strictly to feature constraints provided via metadata and ensures valid and explainable predictions."

When a player appears only once or very few times in the dataset, the model cannot generalize or make accurate predictions for that class, which introduces noise and reduces overall model performance. Additionally, if a rare player appears in the test set but was never seen during training, it can cause errors or unreliable results. By removing these rare classes before splitting the data, we ensure a more balanced and effective training process."

The training data consists of the encoded dataframe with full team lineups and allowed features, including the performance outcomes of teams. This allows the model to learn from a wide range of scenarios across different matchups. The test data, however, is constructed specifically from game segments where the home team performed better (outcome = 1). This ensures that during final evaluation, the model is tested on scenarios where it must predict the fifth home player in a lineup that led to a better home team performance. Each test sample includes the first four home players, all five away players, and other relevant game features.\n",

In other words, if a certain player shows up often in the full dataset, they will show up just as often in both the training and test sets. This helps the model learn and perform fairly across all player types, instead of being biased toward the most common ones."

If there are any player labels that exist in the test set but are completely missing from the training set, the model will not be able to predict them correctly, which could lead to errors or inaccurate results.\n",

We do this by duplicating a random row from `X_train` and assigning the missing label to it in `y_train`. It gives the model a minimal exposure to those labels so it can include them in the prediction class space. Finally, we re-check to confirm that all test labels are now also present in the training set.\n",

    "This feature importance plot shows which input features the XGBoost model relied on most when learning to predict the optimal fifth player in an NBA lineup. The values are based on \"gain,\" which represents how much each feature contributed to improving the model's accuracy during training. From the graph, we see that features like home_3 and home_team have the highest importance, meaning the identity of the fourth home player already in the lineup and the overall team context significantly influence the model’s decisions. Other features like season, home_1, and game also play a key role, highlighting the importance of lineup composition and historical matchup context. In contrast, features such as starting_min, away_0, and away_team have lower importance, indicating they had less impact on the model’s learning process."
